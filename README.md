# Secure-Shettu
“Secure-Shettu is a beginner application security project where I built a password strength checker and a port scanner to understand authentication security and basic network exposure.”
The project consists of two core components: a Password Strength Checker and a Port Scanner, both implemented using Python.

The Password Strength Checker evaluates passwords based on security best practices such as length, use of mixed characters, and complexity, highlighting the importance of strong authentication mechanisms in application security. The Port Scanner identifies open ports on a target system, helping understand how network services expose applications to potential security risks.
